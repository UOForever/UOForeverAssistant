</p>
<p>
    <strong>Version 0.7.6.1 [6/19/2020]</strong>
    <br /> ** These changes are backwards compatible. i.e. if you do nothing, everything should work like it did before
    <br />- This should be confusing, a NEW 7.6 .. but the I changed the json to store some extra data so time to rev
    <br />- Added a destination per item in autoloot. This allows you to direct different items to different containers.
    <br />  The old rules still apply, so if the item specific container doesn't exist, it will try you autoloot container,
    <br />  If the Autoloot container doesn't exist, it will drop in your backpack
    <br />- While I was changing autoloot, Kolka happenned to ask if I could add an option to loot while stealthed.
    <br />  So I added it, but it defaults to False.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Version 0.7.5.54 [6/11/2020]</strong>
    <br />- Revert a Gargoyle fix 8e25f671c210809d72efb9b548ac472762d232d8 It seems to override the standard Weapon Specials in an incorrect way
    <br />- Matsamilla helped make the Main web page more clear in terms of what packages to use

</p>
<p>
    <strong>Version 0.7.5.53 [6/10/2020]</strong>
    <br />- fix an html parsing issue with inspector for Pandora
    <br />- Added a null pointer check in autoloot for when someone removes the item after looting has tried to get it
    <br />- Added functions for Items.UseItemOn and (removed) Player.UseSkillOn. After adding these I found only OSI
    <br />  Servers support UseItemOn, and no one supported UseSkillOn. I left them in as they are documented packets
    <br />  but realistic use is limited.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Version 0.7.5.52 [6/8/2020]</strong>
    <br />- I fixed the mis-counting of items that was also causing RE to be confiused
    <br />  About the Serial # of items that have been dragged
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Version 0.7.5.51 [6/8/2020]</strong>
    <br />- I think I fixed the drag-drop problem CUO users were experiencing
    <br />  The problem appeared to be the dispatch Timer was dieing, and I think it was due to buffer overflow
    <br />  I recommend the object delay on options page never be less than 2X ping speed
    <br />  and the delay after a move should be at about 6X your ping speed
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Version 0.7.5.50 [6/7/2020]</strong>
    <br />- Remove the Map property that showed map co-ordinates after you decoded it.
    <br />  The co-ordinates were not perfect, and there is a bug inserting them into properties for the map.

    <br />- Backported the OSI login fix for the people that still use 6.x

    <br />- Add new parameter to Spell.Cast functions to allow target to be passed on single line
    <br />  This uses a single packet to the server, so no targeting needed
    <br />  Older servers will not support this, so will have to use the old cast / wait target / target which still works
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Version 0.7.5.43 [4/25/2020]</strong>
    <br />- Change the way hot-keys are handled to make wine work better

<br />- Remove all the import export buttons and their code. Since files are all json, the files can just be copied
<br />- Forgot to allow [Band to go with [BandSelf so heal friends wasn working properly

</p>
<p>

    <br />- Optimized autoloot a little. The All GraphIDs are same speed, but specific GraphIDs are a bit faster to look up
    <br />- A change to make RE work better on linux. Testing mostly, shouldn't affect windows users
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Version 0.7.5.30 [3/26/2020]</strong>
    <br />- Add functions for Spell.CastCleric and Spell.CastDruid.
    <br />It just does the [cs spellwithoutspaces but makes the macros easier to read
    <br />Note: The Cleric and Druid are not available for Spell Grid because I don't have icons
    <br />- Add Misc.CaptureNow function
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Version 0.7.5.29 [3/25/2020]</strong>
    <br />- Change Target.Attack per Mourns REAL suggestion. I misunderstood

<p>
    <strong>Version 0.7.5.27 [3/25/2020]</strong>
    <br />- Forgot to add the editor completion for Autoloot.GetList
