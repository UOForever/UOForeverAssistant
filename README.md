## Project History

Razor was originally designed by Bryan Pass, known as Zippy in the RunUO community as a replacement to UOAssist. Based on commit notes, active development on Razor ceased some time in the early 2010's with the source code being released in 2014.

The code initially didn't include Crypt.dll and Loader.dll which are required to full integrate with the UO client. At some point, the code for those projects released into the same [GitHub repo](https://github.com/msturgill/razor).

The original project was last updated May 2nd, 2014 and while over 50 forks exist on GitHub, none of them have been active or have made significant changes except for a few exceptions:

* [Jaedan](https://github.com/jaedan) (which this version is based on) who updated the project to compile and work in Visual Studio 2017 and made improvements to Crypt.dll that enabled this project to move forward.
* [SaschaKP](https://github.com/SaschaKP) who made several performance changes from generic to non-generic collections that I incorporated in the first release.

Razor Enhaced has been [developed](https://bitbucket.org/RazorFork/razor-enhanced/) mainly by [Alexdan2](https://github.com/alexdan) and MagnetoStaff from february 2015 untill january 2019. The actual repo is a fork from that.
